cari - A Fortran Module Library for Computer Arithmetic
=======================================================

This Fortran module library was developped in the purpose to provide
as much control as possible over the floating point arithmetic in a
Fortran system and simultaneously preserve convenience and
portability.

It was motivated by the lectures "Computerarithmetik" and "Numerik mit
Ergebnisverifikation" from 2009 until 2011 of Prof. Wolfgang Walter at
the University of Technology Dresden and the Fortran XSC Module
Library which was also under development in this period by me and
other students at the Institute of Scientific Computing under
supervision of Prof. Walter.
