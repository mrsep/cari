Some remarks about the ANSI-C library fi_lib:
---------------------------------------------

The main features of the library, called fi_lib 
(fast interval library) are:
-  Fast table look-up algortihms are used for the basic functions
   like arctan, exp or log 
-  All elementary function routines are supplied with reliable relative 
   error bounds of high quality.
   The error estimates cover rounding errors, errors introduced by
   not exactly representable constants as well as
   approximation errors (best approximations with reliable error bounds).
-  All error estimates are reliable worst-case estimates, which
   have been derived using interval methods.
-  We only insist in a faithful computer arithmetic. The routines do not
   manipulate the rounding mode of basic operations (setting the rounding 
   mode may be rather expensive).
-  No higher precision internal data format is used. All computations
   are done using the IEEE-double format (64 bit).
-  A C++ interface for easier use is also supplied with the library.
-  To get good portability all programs are written in ANSI-C.
-  Source code and some applications are available:
   http://www.math.uni-wuppertal.de/wrswt/software/filib.html

Improvements and extensions of the library are still in progress.
Please contact from time to time our web server.

How to unpack the source code of the library fi_lib?
----------------------------------------------------
Use the commands

   gunzip fi_lib.tgz
   tar xf fi_lib.tar

They generate the directory tree

   fi_lib               (source code and makefile) 
    |
    |------ test        (integrity test          )  
    |
    |------ example     (some simple applications)

To compile the source code, change the directory

   cd fi_lib

and select the correct entries in the configuration section 
at the beginning of file 'fi_lib.h', then use the command  

   make all

If you have problems with the make command on MS-DOS/Windows PC's you
can use the batch file 'compall.bat'.

Use

   cd test

to change the directory and run the test program 

   fi_test

You should get the final message: 

   'Test for library fi_lib.a OK!'
 
If you have problems:
---------------------
1. Check the configuration section in file 'fi_lib.h'
2. Check the call of the C-compiler in the Makefile   (e.g. CC  = cc   or 
                                                                = gcc  or ... )
3. Check the call of the C++ compiler in the Makefile (e.g. CPP = CC   or 
                                                                = g++  or ... )
4. Check the options for the compiler in the Makefile
   (e.g. on HP-Workstations you must probably use CFLAGS= -Aa and COPT = -O)
   or in the batch file compall.bat
5. Compile the library without any optimization options (e.g. without -O or 
   -O2). Some compilers do some nasty things here.

History
-------
1997/08/20  (Version 1.0) First version available on the FTP-server.
1998/03/18  (Version 1.1) Some modifications in the interval routines
            for the basic operations and in the error handling routines
            have been made (e.g. the input/output of intervals and the 
            test program fi_test have been modified).
            Also some simple application programs have been added. 
2005/12/19  (Version 1.2) Modifications for newer C++ compilers in
            interval.hpp, hornercpp.C, bisection.C, xinewton.C;
	    some minor bug fixes;
	    some new mathematical functions have been added: 
	    error function 
	       q_erf(double x), j_erf(interval x) 
            and complementary error function
	       q_erfc(double x) and j_erfc(interval x)
